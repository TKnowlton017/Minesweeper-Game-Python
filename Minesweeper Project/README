Team Members: Talon Knowlton and Kai Gonzalez

Language: Python 3.8.10

File List:

main_minesweeper.py is where you begin running the game

cell.py creates individual cells as objects and gives them the functionality of the minesweeper game


NOTE: TKinter is already built into python, so there is no need to download anything new. Just run main_minesweeper.
